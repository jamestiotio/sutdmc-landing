                To make a cake, you will need 3 buckets of milk, an egg, two parts of sugar processed from sugarcane, and 3 stalks of wheat. While your factory produces some of the ingredients itself, others are brought in by suppliers at a certain rate. However, with various parts of the process going at different rates, your speed of cake production may get limited. Which part of the process is bottlenecking you? Is it worth investing money in to speed it up? Your task is to optimize your process from gathering the ingredients to crafting the cakes and then shipping them out for profit! Try to be the factory with the most money after 5 minutes!
